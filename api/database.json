It is the national flower of Nepal, the state flower of Washington and West Virginia in the United States, the provincial flower of Jiangxi in China and the state tree of Sikkim and Uttarakhand in India. Most species have brightly colored flowers which bloom from late winter through to early summer.\nAzaleas make up two subgenera of Rhododendron. They are distinguished from \"true\" rhododendrons by having only five anthers per flower.",
